# 🚗 ECU I/O Control Lab

This project explores the integration of analog and digital input/output (I/O) within an Electronic Control Unit (ECU) in a real-time embedded environment. It focuses on understanding how embedded systems handle input signals from sensors and output control signals to actuators in automotive applications.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- **Simulink** – For system modeling and simulation
- **dSPACE (MicroAutoBox)** – For real-time implementation and I/O interface
- **Control Desk** – For real-time data monitoring and signal tuning

## 🧠 What You'll Learn
- Basics of analog and digital I/O in control systems
- Real-time data acquisition and signal processing
- Interfacing sensors and actuators using dSPACE hardware
- Validating system behavior using Control Desk plots
